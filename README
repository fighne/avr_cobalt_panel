This is a small project to connect a AVR microcontroller
(e.g. an "Arduino") to the LCD/Button panel of a Cobalt RaQ3.

I own one of these devices on which the mainboard was unfixably
broken, and I decided to use them as a general purpose case.

Pinout of the 26pin ribbon connector to the frontpanel, with
proposed connection to an AVR Mega168/Arduino:

LCD_x are connections to the hd44780-LCD (with pin numbers in
parentheses). B_x are connections to the buttons. They are put
on the D1..D7 lines when the \OE pin is low (there's a 74HC245
on the frontpanel board). LEDs are all wired up differently:

The network LEDs (Col, Link, 100M, TxRx) have their anodes
wired up to Vcc and expect to be pulled low with a suitable
resistor (say 200Ohms - 1kOhm for 5V). Web has the cathode wired
to ground, Disk has the anode wired to Vcc. Resistors are soldered.
